# notebook-iiif-images
GLAM institutions are starting to adopt new technology and services to provide access to image-based resources in order to encourage research, scholarship and the transmission of cultural knowledge. The International Image Interoperability Framework [IIIF](https://iiif.io/) aims to set of common application programming interfaces that support interoperability between image repositories.

The jupyter notebooks provided in this project while being based on IIIF repositories, extract metadata and images, creating a CSV file representing the dataset as a result. These are examples of exploitation that can serve as a basis for further development.

## accessing-iiif-smithsonian
This [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hibernator11/notebook-iiif-images/blob/master/accessing-iiif-smithsonian.ipynb) extracts a dataset as a CSV file from the [Smithsonian Open Access](https://www.si.edu/openaccess) digital collection. This example performs an automatic search, retrieving the manifests from the IIIF server to create a dataset with the metadata as a CSV file.

In this example, images are treated as an standard NumPy array containing pixels of data points. This notebooks presents an example of face detection based on an image from the repository.

## accessing-iiif-europeana
This [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hibernator11/notebook-iiif-images/blob/master/accessing-iiif-europeana.ipynb) extracts a dataset as a CSV file using the Europeana APIs. This example performs an automatic search, retrieving the manifests from the IIIF server to create a dataset with the metadata as a CSV file. It also includes a code to show the thumbnails as a gallery.

This example shows how to navigate the collection using the API by means of the manifest, annotations and full text resources.

## accessing-iiif-ugent
This [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hibernator11/notebook-iiif-images/blob/master/accessing-iiif-ugent.ipynb) extracts a dataset as a CSV file from the UGent libraries collection. This example performs an automatic search, retrieving the manifests from the IIIF server to create a dataset with the metadata as a CSV file. The content used in this notebook is based on *la Russie illustr√©e* which is a periodical with 15 volumes and 748 issues. The digital content can be retrieved [here](https://lib.ugent.be/viewer/collection/RUG01-001643403#?c=&m=&s=&cv=&xywh=-2290%2C-224%2C7504%2C4200). 


## Requirements
